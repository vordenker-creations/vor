# motion.md — cross-runtime motion ref

How motion behaves across web, React, TUI, and desktop runtimes. Each runtime has a different cost model for motion (frame budget, GPU offload, retained vs immediate mode); the timing bands and easing curves are constants because they map to perception, not implementation.

This file is loaded only via the SKILL.md surface-routing table — surface references (web.md, react.md, tui.md, desktop.md) do not backlink here. A reader needing cross-runtime motion guidance re-enters via SKILL.md.

## 1. Motion-budget doctrine

One intentional moment per surface, the same posture as restraint elsewhere in the design skill (`references/soul.md` §4). Motion is the sharpest tool for surfacing a hierarchy decision — animate the element you want the eye to follow; everything else stays still.

Two failure modes:

- **No motion at all** — state changes feel jarring; the user loses continuity between before and after.
- **Motion on every element** — every animation cancels every other, the eye finds no anchor, and battery drains for noise.

The middle path is one animated transition per state change, with everything else holding the previous frame.

## 2. Timing bands

Time scales are perceptual, not arbitrary. Five bands cover production motion needs across runtimes:

- **~80ms** — perceptual "instant" threshold. Below this, the user does not register a transition; above, motion becomes communication.
- **100-150ms** — instant feedback (button press, hover state, focus ring).
- **200-300ms** — state changes (panel open, input focus, tab switch).
- **300-500ms** — layout changes (modal entrance, card flip, drawer slide).
- **500-800ms** — page entrance, hero reveal, first paint.

Exit durations run ~75% of entrance — quick to leave, deliberate to arrive.

## 3. Named easing curves

Three curves cover production motion needs. Bounce and elastic curves are banned — they read as 2015-trendy on production surfaces in 2026, and they undermine the credibility of the surface they decorate.

```css
:root {
  --ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);   /* default */
  --ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
  --ease-out-expo:  cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);   /* heaviest */
}
```

Pick one curve per surface and commit; switching curves between adjacent components reads as inconsistency.

## 3.5. Premium motion materials

Transform and opacity are reliable defaults, not the whole palette. Premium interfaces often reach for atmospheric properties: blur reveals, backdrop-filter panels, saturation or brightness shifts, shadow bloom, SVG filters, masks, clip paths, gradient-position movement, and variable-font or shader-driven effects.

Pick the material to fit the effect.

| Material | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `transform` / `opacity` | Movement, press feedback, simple reveals, list choreography. |
| `filter` / `backdrop-filter` (blur, saturation, brightness) | Focus pulls, depth, glass-and-lens effects, softened entrances, atmospheric transitions. |
| `clip-path` / mask | Wipes, reveals, editorial cropping, product-style transitions. |
| `box-shadow` / `filter: drop-shadow` / hue rotation | Energy, affordance, focus, warmth, active-state signals. |
| `grid-template-rows` change with FLIP transforms | Expanding and reflowing layout without animating `height` directly. |

**Hard rules.** Avoid animating layout-driving properties casually (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, margins) — they trigger layout, which is the costliest pipeline stage. Keep expensive effects bounded to small or isolated areas. Verify in-browser on the target viewport before shipping; subjective premium falls apart if the result janks at 30fps.

## 3.6. Staggered animations

Use CSS custom properties for clean stagger.

```css
.list-item {
  animation: slide-up 400ms var(--ease-out-quart) both;
  animation-delay: calc(var(--i, 0) * 50ms);
}
```

```html
<li class="list-item" style="--i: 0">…</li>
<li class="list-item" style="--i: 1">…</li>
<li class="list-item" style="--i: 2">…</li>
```

**Cap the total stagger.** 10 items × 50ms = 500ms total. For lists longer than ~12 items, reduce per-item delay (e.g. 30ms) or cap the staggered count (first 8 stagger; the rest fade in together). Unbounded stagger lengthens perceived load time without adding meaning.

## 4. Web (vanilla CSS)

Animate `transform` and `opacity` by default — they composite on the GPU without forcing layout. Layout-driving properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `padding`, `margin`, `font-size`) force synchronous reflow every frame; the result is jank, not motion. Reach for the broader premium-material palette in §3.5 (blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask) only when the effect earns its cost — bound the affected area, verify on the target viewport, and accept the risk that the same effect may need to drop to a fade fallback on weaker hardware or when `prefers-reduced-data` / `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.

```css
/* Good — composited transform + opacity. */
.card {
  transition: transform 200ms var(--ease-out-quart),
              opacity   200ms var(--ease-out-quart);
}

/* Bad — layout-property animation. */
.card { transition: width 200ms; }  /* forces reflow every frame */
```

View Transitions API (same-document: Chromium 111+, Safari 18.2+, Firefox 144+) handles cross-state morphs without manual paired keyframes — declare which elements share identity across states; the browser interpolates the rest.

`animation-timeline: scroll()` for scroll-driven progress without a JS scroll listener (Chromium stable, Safari 26+, Firefox flag-gated). Falls back gracefully — scroll-driven becomes "animation runs once" on engines that do not yet implement it.

SVG transforms quirk: `transform-origin` on SVG elements inside a parent `<svg>` is interpreted in user-coordinate space by default. Set `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center;` on a wrapping `<g>` to scale or rotate around the element's own center rather than the SVG's origin.

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is non-optional — browsers expose the OS-level reduce-motion preference, and a substantial fraction of users (see §8) need it honored. Skipping the media query is an accessibility regression, not an aesthetic preference.

## 5. React

`<ViewTransition>` and `addTransitionType()` ship in React's Experimental / Canary channel as of 19.2 (not stable). Treat as preview APIs. The browser primitive (View Transitions API) is the stable substrate; React's wrapper layers on top.

Reserve `name` for shared-element transitions only; non-shared enter / exit omits `name` and React picks per-render IDs.

For the per-type animation map, motion-budget priority table, and CSS recipes targeting the spec-defined `:active-view-transition-type()` pseudo-class, see `references/react.md` §6 — that section is the canonical specification for React-specific View Transition usage.

Outside View Transitions, the same web rules apply: animate `transform` / `opacity` by default (premium materials per §3.5 only when measured), defer to `useLayoutEffect` for measurement-driven motion (never read layout in render), and budget the motion within a single React commit.

## 6. TUI (terminal UI)

Terminal UIs budget motion in **frames**, not milliseconds. A 60fps terminal is rare; assume 30fps as the realistic ceiling on modern terminals (Kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, Alacritty) with a substantial latency floor on iTerm2 and Windows Terminal under heavy I/O.

Bubble Tea v2's Cursed Renderer (stable Feb 2026) is ~10× faster on update-heavy frames vs the v1 renderer — partial-redraw + cursor diff replaces full-screen rewrite. For high-update TUIs (live logs, real-time graphs, animated status indicators), the v1 → v2 upgrade lifts the realistic frame budget out of the "noticeable lag" band.

Ratatui (Rust) is immediate-mode — every frame redraws from state; motion budget is "do less work per frame" rather than "schedule fewer animations". Textual (Python) shares the immediate-mode posture but adds a CSS-like layout layer that pays its own per-frame cost.

Animated motion in TUIs earns its weight when used and is rare by default:

- Spinners on long-running operations (subtle, single-character cycle).
- Progress bars that fill (a single line, no cursor jumps).
- Selection highlight that fades on focus change (only when the renderer guarantees flicker-free repaint).

Avoid motion entirely when the terminal cannot guarantee atomic redraws — flicker is louder than the affordance the motion was supposed to surface.

## 7. Desktop (Tauri / Slint / egui / Iced)

Retained-mode runtimes (Tauri, Slint, Iced) maintain a scene graph between frames; motion is a property mutation that the framework interpolates. Token discipline matters: hardcoded durations or curves embedded in components defeat the framework's reuse story. Push timings to a tokens file; reference by name.

Immediate-mode runtimes (egui) rebuild the UI tree every frame; motion is achieved by mutating styled state per frame and letting the immediate-mode loop redraw. Egui's animation helpers (`ctx.animate_value_with_time()`) abstract the per-frame mutation; reach for them rather than rolling a manual time accumulator.

Cross-platform native menus and system dialogs respect OS-level reduce-motion preferences automatically (macOS / Windows / GNOME). In-app motion does NOT — implement the same `prefers-reduced-motion` semantics manually via the framework's accessibility API:

- Tauri: `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` from the webview.
- Slint: read the system preference via the platform integration; `1.18` ships an explicit `Window::reduce-motion` property on supported backends.
- Iced: read OS accessibility settings via the `iced::system` module.

## 8. Reduced motion

Roughly 35% of adults aged 40+ report vestibular sensitivity to large-area parallax, spinning, or zooming animations (CDC and interaction-design research). The browser, OS, and several frameworks expose a "reduce motion" preference that the user sets globally; honoring it is non-optional.

Web: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` scopes suppression to vestibular-trigger patterns (large-area transforms, parallax, page transitions) rather than every transition globally:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Suppress motions that risk a vestibular trigger — large-area transforms,
     parallax, autoplay video, full-page transitions. */
  .hero-parallax,
  .page-transition,
  [data-motion="parallax"] {
    animation: none !important;
    transform: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }

  /* Swap suppressed entrances to a 120ms crossfade. !important on every
     sibling property so component-level transitions cannot fight the
     fallback. */
  .modal-entrance,
  .panel-slide,
  [data-motion="entrance"] {
    animation: simple-fade 120ms ease both !important;
    transform: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }

  /* Subtle feedback (focus ring, hover, button press) is left alone —
     these do not trigger vestibular responses and are part of normal
     state communication. */
}

@keyframes simple-fade {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to   { opacity: 1; }
}
```

The pattern is "honor the preference for motions that risk a vestibular trigger; do not blanket-suppress every transition." A focus ring fading in 120ms is safe; a full-screen parallax scrolling at 60% of viewport height is not. Crossfade is the universal safe fallback for the suppressed surfaces.

## 9. Perceived performance

Nobody cares how fast a surface is — only how fast it *feels*. Perception is often as effective as raw performance.

**The 80ms threshold.** Human sensory perception buffers input for ~80ms to synchronize across modalities. Anything under 80ms feels instant. This is the target for micro-interactions (button press feedback, hover affordances, toggle states).

**Active vs. passive time.** Passive waiting (staring at a spinner) feels longer than active engagement. Three strategies shift the balance:

- **Preemptive start** — begin the transition immediately while loading (iOS app-zoom, skeleton UI). The user perceives work happening *during* the wait.
- **Early completion** — show content progressively (video buffering, progressive images, streaming HTML); never wait for everything before showing anything.
- **Optimistic UI** — update the interface immediately, handle failures gracefully (Instagram likes work offline; the UI updates instantly, syncs later). Use for low-stakes actions; avoid for payments and destructive operations (see `interaction-design.md` "Loading states").

**Easing affects perceived duration.** `ease-in` (accelerating toward completion) makes tasks feel shorter because the peak-end effect weights the final moments heavily. `ease-out` feels satisfying for entrances; `ease-in` toward task completion compresses perceived time.

**Caveat.** Too-fast responses can *reduce* perceived value. Users distrust instant results for complex operations (search analysis, AI generation) — a brief intentional delay signals real work is happening. The same engineering that makes a payment confirmation feel instantaneous can make an analysis feel suspect.

**Implementation hygiene.** Do not set `will-change` preemptively — apply only when animation is imminent (`:hover`, `.is-animating` class), then remove. For scroll-triggered animations use IntersectionObserver, not scroll listeners; unobserve after firing once.
